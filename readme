This project is focused on the idea of learning / using as much of the ATS programs as possible in efforts of job search. 

The Application Tracking System that most companies use can be reverse engineered by knowing what the software does, and thus creating each feature to reproduce those behaviors. 

This verison of the simple ATS, simply extracts and counts the number of keywords within a body of text. 

A word is determined by there being spaces on both sides, and a count is added to each word.
